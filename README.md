Secure-Messaging
================

A secure messaging app (mockup) for android.

This is mostly a UI mockup. It doesn't currently do any crypto and I don't have the server source. Also, the database code is pretty unstable.

The main purpose of this project was to try to make a usable secure messaging application UI that didn't require users to understand things like the PGP web of trust. The identity scheme employed in this app assumes that users don't care about their correspondents' legal identities; this makes things quite a bit simpler and actually improves overall security (because the app doesn't make any guarantees it can't keep).
